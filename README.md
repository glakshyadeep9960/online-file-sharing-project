A powerful and efficient backend for an online file-sharing platform, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).
This repository focuses solely on the backend, providing robust APIs for managing file uploads, downloads, and sharing.

üöÄ Features
File Uploads: Securely handle file uploads with proper validations.
File Sharing: Generate shareable links for seamless file sharing.
Efficient Storage: Leverage MongoDB to manage file metadata.
Scalable APIs: Designed to handle a large number of file transactions.
Error Handling: Built-in mechanisms for smooth and reliable API responses.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Node.js: Backend runtime for building server-side logic.
Express.js: Framework for handling API routes and middleware.
MongoDB: Database for storing metadata about shared files.
Multer: Middleware for managing file uploads.

Currently Working on it.

This Code don't include env file and uploads folder ok for security reasons, so you have to create a env file with your own mongo url configurations, email configurations for nodemailer and have to create a uploads folder in root directory so that uploaded images can reside there.
